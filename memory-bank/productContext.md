# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The Midburn art installation project addresses the need for sophisticated, interactive art experiences that combine technology with human creativity. Traditional art installations are static, but this project creates dynamic, responsive environments that engage participants in real-time.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Static Art Limitations** - Transforms static displays into interactive experiences
2. **Manual Control Complexity** - Automates complex lighting and appliance sequences
3. **Audience Engagement** - Creates participatory art experiences
4. **Technical Integration** - Demonstrates IoT capabilities in artistic contexts

## How It Should Work
The system operates as a coordinated network where:
- The main control application orchestrates the overall experience
- Raspberry Pi manages stage appliances via Tuya LSPA10 WiFi sockets
- ESP devices provide interactive elements (LEDs, buttons)
- All components communicate in real-time for synchronized experiences

## User Experience Goals
1. **Artists/Operators**
   - Intuitive control interfaces
   - Real-time status monitoring
   - Easy configuration and programming
   - Reliable operation during events

2. **Event Participants**
   - Seamless interactive experiences
   - Responsive feedback to actions
   - Engaging visual and audio elements
   - Memorable art interactions

## Core User Journeys
1. **Setup Phase**
   - Configure devices and networks
   - Program lighting and appliance sequences
   - Test all components and integrations

2. **Operation Phase**
   - Monitor system status in real-time
   - Execute pre-programmed sequences
   - Respond to interactive inputs
   - Handle unexpected situations gracefully

3. **Maintenance Phase**
   - Diagnose and resolve issues
   - Update configurations and programs
   - Scale and enhance the system

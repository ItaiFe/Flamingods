STAGE ESP32 WIRING DIAGRAM
==========================

ESP32 Development Board Connections
==================================

Power Supply:
- VIN (or 5V) -> 5V Power Supply (for LED strip)
- GND -> Common Ground (connect to power supply ground)

LED Strip Connection:
=====================

Single LED Strip (WS2812B):
- Data Pin -> GPIO 4
- VCC -> 5V Power Supply
- GND -> Common Ground

USB Programming:
- USB-C Cable -> Computer for programming and debugging

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

1. POWER REQUIREMENTS:
   - Each WS2812B LED can draw up to 60mA at full brightness
   - 1 strip × 100 LEDs × 60mA = up to 6A total current
   - Use a 5V power supply rated for at least 8A
   - Do NOT power LEDs from ESP32's 5V pin (insufficient current)

2. GROUND CONNECTION:
   - All grounds must be connected together
   - ESP32 ground must connect to power supply ground
   - LED strip ground must connect to power supply ground

3. DATA SIGNAL:
   - Single data line to GPIO 4
   - Data line is 3.3V logic level (ESP32 compatible)
   - Keep data line as short as possible
   - Avoid interference from power lines

4. POWER DISTRIBUTION:
   - Use thick wires for power distribution
   - Consider using a power distribution board
   - Add capacitors (1000µF) near LED strip for stability

RECOMMENDED COMPONENTS:
========================

Power Supply:
- 5V, 8A switching power supply
- Power distribution board
- Fuse protection (8A)

Wiring:
- 22 AWG or thicker for power lines
- 24 AWG for data line
- Heat shrink tubing for connections
- Cable ties for organization

Safety:
- Power supply with overcurrent protection
- Proper grounding
- Ventilation for power supply
- Fuse protection for LED strip

TROUBLESHOOTING:
=================

1. LEDs not lighting:
   - Check power supply voltage (should be 5V)
   - Verify ground connections
   - Check data pin connection to GPIO 4
   - Ensure power supply can handle current load

2. Erratic LED behavior:
   - Check for loose connections
   - Verify power supply stability
   - Check for interference on data line
   - Ensure proper grounding

3. ESP32 not responding:
   - Check USB connection
   - Verify power to ESP32
   - Check serial monitor for error messages
   - Verify WiFi credentials

4. WiFi connection issues:
   - Check network availability
   - Verify SSID and password
   - Check signal strength
   - Ensure network allows ESP32 connections

5. LED patterns not working:
   - Verify single LED strip connection
   - Check GPIO 4 connection
   - Ensure proper power supply capacity
   - Check for loose connections
